Privacy Policy for “Toochooz”

Last updated: May 2025

1. Introduction
“Toochooz” (the “App”) helps couples discover where to eat by presenting swipable restaurant “cards” with name, hours, and logo/profile photo. We respect your privacy and explain below what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

2. Information We Collect
a. Restaurant Data

Name, City, State: Obtained from the open-source Overture Maps dataset.

Operating Hours & Profile Photo: Fetched via the Facebook Graph API for public pages (“place” type).

Coordinates (latitude, longitude): Used internally to filter results by radius.

b. Your Location (Optional)

Approximate Location: If you choose to allow location access, we use it only to show nearby restaurants. We do not store your precise GPS coordinates.

3. How We Use Your Data

Restaurant Display: To populate and filter the swipe cards you see.

Offline Storage: We save all fetched restaurant data (names, hours, images) in our Firebase backend so that the App runs quickly without refetching each time.

Location Filtering: If granted, your location is used in real time to show restaurants within your selected radius; it is not persisted.

4. Third-Party Services

Facebook Graph API: To enrich each restaurant’s card with hours and profile photos.

Firebase: To store and serve the restaurant database and any user-selected preferences (no personal user accounts required).

Overture Maps Dataset: Our base source for restaurant names and locations.

5. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not share your personal information with any third party. Restaurant data (hours, photos) is publicly available via Facebook pages and Overture Maps; we merely cache it for performance.

6. Security
We follow industry-standard practices to protect our Firebase database. Access tokens for external APIs (e.g. Facebook App Token) are stored securely on our servers and are never exposed in the client.

7. Children’s Privacy
Our App is intended for users aged 13 and up. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with an updated “Last updated” date.
